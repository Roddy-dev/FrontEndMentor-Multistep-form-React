## My process

I initially read about React hook form from an article bu Robin Wieruth (The road to react book). This seemed to me a perfect oppertunity to try this out with the front end mentor project here.

For the CSS I had a main index.css file using the principles learned from Kevin Powells CSS demystified course to do the bulk of the work. I used inline styles in the jsx for error handling and also a standalone CSS file only concerned with a switch component. This for for ease of maintainence and avoiding naming clashes.

### Built with
